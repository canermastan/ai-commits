# AI-Commits: The Commit Message Generator 

> üöÄ Write meaningful commit messages in seconds with AI-powered suggestions!

AI-Commits is a command-line tool that generates conventional commit messages by analyzing your staged changes. It understands your code changes and explanation, then generates a clear, descriptive commit message in English following the Conventional Commits format.

##  Installation
### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.1 or later must be installed. [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Install via `go install` (recommended)

```bash
go install github.com/canermastan/ai-commits@latest
```

After installation, make sure $GOPATH/bin (usually ~/go/bin) is in your PATH, so you can use it globally:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Then simply run:

```bash
ai-commits
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **If you get a checksum error (SECURITY ERROR), it may be due to corrupted local Go module cache. Try these steps:**

```bash
go clean -modcache
go install github.com/canermastan/ai-commits@latest
```

If you still have issues, as a last resort, you can disable checksum verification (not recommended for production environments):

```bash
GOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off go install github.com/canermastan/ai-commits@latest
```

### ‚ö° Option 2: Build manually

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/canermastan/ai-commits.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ai-commits

# Build the project
go build

# Optional: Add to your PATH for global usage
```

## üîë Configuration

1. Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
# For Windows PowerShell
 $env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key"

# For Linux/macOS
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## üíª Usage

```bash
# Normal mode (interactive)
ai-commits

# Fast mode (non-interactive)
ai-commits --fast
```

### Example Flow
1. Stage your changes with `git add`
2. Run `ai-commits`
